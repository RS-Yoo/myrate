# MyRate

MyRate will allow users to rate content in a more specialized way. It  will include more search filters and update the rating system to allow for more in depth star reviews as well as descriptive reviews for multiple forms of media.  


## Getting started
To run our project open two terminals. In the first, navigate into myrate/myrate/myrate_backend/server and start the server with the command 'node server.js' 
In the second terminal navigate into myrate/myrate_frontend and start our application with the command 'npm start'
At this point MyRate will open in your preferred browser and is ready to go.

Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
